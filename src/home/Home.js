        <h2>Something</h2>
      <p>Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a
      mountain. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Let's build some
       happy little clouds up here. There's not a thing in the world wrong with
        washing your brush. This is the time to get out all your flustrations,
        much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on
        your spouse. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big
        clouds.</p>

        <p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.
         Working it up and down, back and forth.u The first step to doing
         anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind
         before you ever start.</p>

         <p>We don't have anything but happy trees here. The least little bit can do so
  much. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. That's what makes
   life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that
    you want.</p>
<h2>Something</h2>
<p>Put it in, leave it alone. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. It's cold, but it's beautiful. See there how easy that is. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. This is your world.</p>

<p>I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>

<p>I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. This is unplanned it really just happens. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>

<p>Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.</p>
